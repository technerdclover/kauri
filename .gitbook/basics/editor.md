# Basic I/O

## Getting Input

To get an input, you can use the `prompt` function. This function can be used with and without a prompt specified, though it is recommended to use a prompt when asking for an input.

```typescript
// This will retrieve the user's input without a prompt.
prompt();

// If you want to use a prompt, then you can put a string inside of the parentheses.
prompt("Type something: ");
```

## Sending Output

To output something, whether it be a variable, equation, or string, you can use the `print` and `println` functions. Using `print` will print the value without a newline, while `println` will add a newline at the end.

```typescript
// Here's some examples of print:
print(x); // Assumes that x has a value, we'll touch on that later.
print(3 + 3);
print("Hello, World!");

/* Result would be:
    void6Hello, World!
*/

// Using println works the same way, simply swap it out.
println(x);
println(3 + 3);
println("Hello, World!");

/* Result would be: 
    void
    6
    Hello, World!
*/
```

When printing values, you can also use string interpolation, which will swap out a text segment with a variable.&#x20;

```typescript
// This will print the value of the "score" variable along with some text.
println("The score value is: <$score>")
```
