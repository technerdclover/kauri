# Learning The Basics

As a beginner, the Kauri programming language might look intimidating. There's a bunch of functions, the code might not be close to what you're familiar with, and it can be overwhelming. Luckily, this section has been handcrafted to teach you how to work with Kauri.

Firstly, you'll need to learn what some of the basic functions _are_. They'll be explained in more detail later, but for know, knowing what a function generally does is your best interest.
